        Hi! My name is Riley and I am currently a junior studying computer science at Colorado State University. I have loved technology since I was a kid and 
        I always was super interested in what my brother was doing as he was studying computer engineering. I started learning about software development in high school 
        and I found a particular interest in iOS mobile app development and frontend/UI work.
