        Hi! My name is Riley and I am currently a junior studying computer science at Colorado State University. I have loved technology since I was a kid and 
        I always was super interested in what my brother was doing as he was studying computer engineering. I started learning about software development in high school 
        and I found a particular interest in iOS mobile app development and frontend/UI work.

        Hello, My name is Paige and I am finishing up my last semester in Computer Science as Colorado State University. 
        I am hoping to go into a front end development job once I graduate with my bachlors degree. I gain so much more enjoyment out of the visual changes
        my code does rather than the backend security as important as that role is. I am an avid reader my favorite genre is science fiction (of course) with my 
        favorite author being Isaac Asimov. One of my favorite hobbies is to re-create websites based on what I think they look like from a book I have read!

        Hi. My name is Rose I have been coding for about a year and a half now. I have always loved solving problems and working through issues
        which is why I was drawn to Computer Science. I am a junior here at Colorado State. I play club volleyball, snowboard and love to read.
        I am looking to work in either the field of CyberSecurity or AI (I haven't fully explored either yet).
